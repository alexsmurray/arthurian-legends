                <h1>Welcome to Camelot</h1>
            <p>
                In a land of myth and a time of magic, the kingdom of Camelot is one of the great five kingdoms that rule over the land known as Albion. Camelot is known for being the strongest, wealthiest, and most noble kingdom of its time. The castle itself is said to be nearly impenetrable to attackers. Camelot stands as a utopia, uniting all within the kingdom as equals despite their status in the heirarchy.

            <h3>The Story of King Arthur</h3>
                <p>
                    The young Arthur Pendragon was destined from birth to become the greatest king of all time. Trained by his father and king, Uther Pendragon, how to use a sword, Arthur became a brave knight and lead the mighty army of Camelot. He was sent out on various quests, dealing with invaders, bandits, mystical creatures, and the evil forces of magic. Such tasks come at a great risk, but Arthur was never alone.
                     Along his journies, his path was crossed by many, including Merlin, who would later be famed as the most powerful sorcerer to ever live, as well as, with many other brave and noble men from all walks of life and willing to throw their lives on the line for Arthur's sake. These men would be inducted as the Knights of the Round Table. The Round Table was a symbol of equality, and all who sat there were seen as such regardless of status.
                     Arthur trained these knights himself and created a force that could not be broken. Arthur and his knights were like brothers and the bond they shared was forged by trust and respect for one another. As Arthur grew and took the crown as king after the death of his father, he took a servant, Guinevere, as his wife and queen. This was only the beginning for King Arthur, for once he took the thrown, he was met with many enemies who would seek to take his place as ruler of Camelot.
                     One such enemy was his own half-sister, Morgana, who grew jealous of Arthur and believed that she should be the one to wear the crown. Morgana was a powerful witch and used dark magic to thwart Arthur. While many attacks were made against the great kingdom and lives were lost, Arthur, Merlin, and his knights held their ground and defended Camelot. During this time however, Arthur felt he was not worthy to hold such a title. The sorcerer Merlin sent him on a quest to retrieve a sword.
                     This sword was cast into a stone and was said to only be wielded by one who was worthy. The doubtful Arthur found the sword and grabbed the handle. As he pulled, he freed the sword from the stone proving to himself that he was worthy once more. This sword would become known as the legendary Excalibur. After defeated Morgana, however, Arthur would soon find his downfall. Betrayed but his wife, Guinevere, and his most trusted knight, Lancelot, who had an affair, Arthur would leave to duel Lancelot. 
                     During this time, Arthur's own son, Mordred, would claim that Arthur had died in battle and take the thrown for himself. Arthur would learn of his son's deceit and returned to Camelot. A battle betweem Arthur and Mordred ensued. Arthur defeated Mordred, but was left mortally wounded, leaving Arthur to an untimely death. King Arthur had built his kingdom on the foundation of love and trust with his people, but, ultimately, it would be his own undoing.
